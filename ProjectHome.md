  * (21.02.2011) We'll adding support mShell version and both of Symbian v2 v3 and v5 editions.
We probably move our project from python to mShell, or we just continue both of these languages, because mShell is as good as python and, it's libraries are most powerful and robust (at least better) than python (2.2x on -my symbian phone). We're release  Notepad++ v0.5b version with two platform option; a python SIS and PY file , and mShell M , MEX and SIS files, both these files will support Symbian v2 and v3 platforms (maybe python releases cannot start in v2 platform.)
We are working on project, so if you want to contribute, then contact me in my email, otherwise we are unfortunately provide the first releases(they are _deprecated_.)
